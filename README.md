# MemoryGame

A terminal-based version of the classic matching game. The player is presented with a grid of 36 cards, 2 of which they may flip on each turn. If a match is made, the player earns 5 points. Otherwise, a point is deducted. Use your memory to minimize the number of moves and maximize your points!
